## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Prometheus URL**:

   ```json
   {
     "proxy": "https://your-prometheus-url.com"
   }
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## URL Structure

- `/` - Redirects to Groups page
- `/groups` - Main groups overview and management
- `/targets` - All targets table
- `/targets/:targetId` - Individual target details
- `/reports` - Report generation
- `/settings` - Configuration and settings

## Dependencies

- React 18.2.0
